# Socket Card Game
A small, small, small attempt at trying to get a Trading Card Game (like Magic The Gathering) to work as a Javascript and Socket.io application.

## Usage
Really, you shouldn't. But..  
1. Git clone the project
2. `npm install`
3. `node server.js`
4. Get a server up and running. I.e. `php -S localhost:8000`
5. Visit said server (Websocket connection runs at :3000)
